# CAF Migration Model

This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), explains the theory behind the migration model. This section of content attempts to maintain a vendor neutral position, where ever possible. The objective of this section is to guide the reader in establishing processes and activities that can be applied to any cloud migration, regardless of the chosen vendor.

## Establishing an end state

A journey without a target destination is just wandering. Itâ€™s important to establish a rough vision of the end state before taking the first step. The infographic below outlines a starting point consisting of existing applications, data, and infrastructure, which defines the Digital Estate. During the migration process, those assets are transitioned into one of the options on the right.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During this public preview of the framework, this section of the CAF focuses heavily on a Rehost approach to migration. Other sections and future evolutions of this content will expand on other approaches.

## Incremental Migration Model

The theory behind the CAF Migration Model is based on the execution of the processes and pre-requisites referenced in the infographic below.

This theory serves as an end state describing a very mature process for migration. The guidance in this section should not be viewed as a required starting point. Instead it is advised that readers reference this content to define the best processes to support their unique organizational goals.
