# Expanded scope for cloud migration

This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework outlines and addresses a number of the reason that the scope of a migration would need to be expanded.

## Getting Started

The [baseline migration guide](../baseline-migration-guide/index.md) in the Cloud Adoption Framework is the suggested starting point for readers who are interested in a re-host migration to Azure, also known as a Lift and Shift migration. That guide will walk the reader through a series of pre-requisites, tools, and approaches to migrating virtual machines to the cloud.

While the baseline migration guide is effective at getting the reader familiar with this style of migration, it is based on a number of assumptions. Those assumptions ensure that the guide aligns to a large percentage of the readers of the Cloud Adoption Framework, by providing a simplified approach to migrations.

This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework addresses a series of more complex scenarios that require enhanced scope. In each scenario, this guide outlines the need and necessary scope changes to address the additional complexity.
