# Migrating at scale

- **Migrating at scale:** Migrations exceeding 2,000 assets are likely to run into constraints that require additional planning and a disciplined approach to execution. The Assess and Migrate processes are adjusted to account for scale complexity.

## General scope expansion

Summarize the general approach to overcoming this challenge

## Suggested pre-requisites

What should be done prior to the migration process to reduce the impact of this complexity.

## Assess process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the assess process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Migrate process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the migrate process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Optimize and promote process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the optimize and promote process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Secure and manage process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the secure and manage process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.
