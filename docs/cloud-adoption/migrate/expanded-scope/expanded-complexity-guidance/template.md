# Name of the complexity being addressed

Describe the complexity and cause

## Approach to addressing complexity

Summarize the general approach to overcoming this challenge

## Assess process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the assess process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Migrate process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the migrate process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Optimize and promote process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the optimize and promote process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Secure and manage process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the secure and manage process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.
