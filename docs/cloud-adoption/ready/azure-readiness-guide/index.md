When you deploy resources to Azure, you have flexibility on the types of resources to deploy, where they are located, and how to set them up. But that flexibility may open more options than you would like to allow in your organization. As you consider deploying resources to Azure, you might wonder:

* How do I ensure that someone does not inadvertently change a critical system?
* How do I control costs?
* How do I track resource costs and bill it accurately?
* How do I ensure my subscriptions are compliant and meet regulations?
* How do I meet legal requirements for data sovereignty in certain countries?

This playbook helps address those questions. It suggests the tasks and features you should consider as you get ready to deploy resources in Azure. Specifically, you:
