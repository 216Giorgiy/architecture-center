# Existing data center constraints

- **Existing data center constraints:** Often times companies choose to migrate to the cloud because the capacity, speed, and stability of an existing data center is no longer satisfactory. Unfortunately, those same constraints add complexity to the migration process, requiring additional planning during the assessment and migration processes.

## Approach to addressing complexity

Summarize the general approach to overcoming this challenge

## Suggested pre-requisites

What should be done prior to the migration process to reduce the impact of this complexity.

## Assess process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the assess process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Migrate process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the migrate process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Optimize and promote process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the optimize and promote process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Secure and manage process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the secure and manage process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.
