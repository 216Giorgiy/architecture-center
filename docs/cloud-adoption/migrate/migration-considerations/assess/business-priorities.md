# Business Priorities: Maintaining alignment

Transformation is often defined as a dramatic or spontaneous change. At the board level, change can look like a dramatic transformation. However, for those of us who work through the process of change in an organization, transformation is a bit misleading. Under the surface, transformation is really better described as a series of properly executed transitions from one state to another.

In some cases, rationalization or transition of a single workload can happen quickly. Sometimes groups of applications can even be transitioned relatively quickly. Even in those cases, it takes time to produce substantial changes amongst a user base. It takes even longer for changes to propagate through various layers of existing business processes. If transformation is expected to shape behavior patterns in consumers, the results can take even longer to produce significant results.

Unfortunately, the market doesn't wait for businesses to transition. Consumer behavior patterns change on their own, often times unexpectedly. The market's perception of a company and its products can be swayed by social media or a competitor's positioning. Fast and unexpected market changes require companies to be nimble and responsive.

Executing processes and technical transitions, requires a consistent stable effort. Responding to market conditions requires quick decisions and nimble actions. These two are at odds, making it easy for priorities to fall out of alignment. This article describes approaches to maintaining transitional alignment during migration efforts.

## How can business and technical priorities stay aligned during a migration?

The Cloud Adoption Team and Cloud Governance Team focus on the execution of the current iteration and current release. Iterations provide stable increments of technical work. This avoids costly disruptions that would otherwise slow the progress of migration efforts. Releases ensure that the technical effort and energy stays focused on a business objective (applications or workloads). A migration project could require many releases over an extended period of time. By the time a migration project is completed, market conditions have likely changed significantly.

In parallel, the Cloud Strategy Team focuses on executing the business change plan and preparing for the next release. The strategy team generally looks at least one release ahead. The strategy team monitors for changing market conditions and adjusts the migration backlog accordingly. This focus of managing transformation and adjusting the plan creates natural pivots around the technical work. When business priorities change, adoption is only one release behind, creating technical and business agility.

## Business Alignment Questions

The following questions can help the Cloud Strategy Team shape and prioritize the migration backlog to ensure the transformation effort best aligns with current business needs.

* Are the top 10 applications or workloads ready for migration?
* Does the Cloud Adoption Team and Cloud Governance Team have all of the necessary data to be successful?
* Does the application at the top of the list deliver the most relevant impact for the business in the next release?
* Are there other applications that should be at the top of the list?

## Tangible actions

During the execution of the Business Change Plan, the Cloud Strategy Team monitors for positive and negative results. When those observations require technical change, the adjustments are added as work items to the release backlog to be prioritized in the next iteration.

When the market changes, the Cloud Strategy Team works with the business to understand how to best respond to the changes. When that response requires a change in migration priorities, the migration backlog is adjusted. This moves up applications that were previously lower in priority.
