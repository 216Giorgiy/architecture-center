# Skills readiness

- **Organizational complexity (Skills readiness):** When the Cloud Adoption Team or other supporting teams are not ready to execute, it can quickly inject complexity throughout the migration effort. This challenge is addressed during each of the migration processes in a specific page on skills readiness.

## Approach to addressing complexity

Summarize the general approach to overcoming this challenge

## Suggested pre-requisites

What should be done prior to the migration process to reduce the impact of this complexity.

## Assess process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the assess process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Migrate process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the migrate process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Optimize and promote process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the optimize and promote process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Secure and manage process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the secure and manage process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.
