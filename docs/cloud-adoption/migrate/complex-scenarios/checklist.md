# Cloud migration complexity checklist

The following checklist outlines the areas of complexity addressed by this guide.

- Balancing the portfolio
- Business justification
- Change management and approval processes
- Organizational complexity (Executive readiness)
- Organizational complexity (Skills readiness)
- Aligning support (Partner and other support options)
- Existing data center constraints
- Migrating at scale - High volume or velocity of migrations
- Multiple geographical regions
- Multiple data centers
- Governance or compliance strategy
- Technical complexity (Change management)

If any of these complexities align with the reader's scenario, then this section of the Cloud Adoption Framework will likely provide the type of guidance needed during the migration process.

Various different point of complexity require different actions during each of the migration processes: [Assess](./assess/index.md), [Migrate](./migrate/index.md), [Optimize](./optimize-and-promote/index.md), & [Secure and Manage](./secure-and-manage/index.md). To better align with the reader's current challenges, the areas of complexity are distributed across the processes. The intro to each process will outline the complexities addressed in that section with links to the relevant guidance.

For an alternative view, see the [expanded complexity guidance section](./expanded-complexity-guidance/index.md) at the end of this guide, which will provide links back to the various points of guidance across each of the processes.

## Complexities explained

The following expand on the short checklist above to aid the reader's understanding of each point of complexity. These brief statements are designed to add clarity beyond the brief titles above.

### Business Complexity

- **Balancing the portfolio:** The cloud strategy team is interested in investing more heavily in migration or innovation. Often times a balance between the two priorities is the key to success. In this guide, the topic of balancing the cloud adoption portfolio is a common topic, addressed in each of the migrate processes.
- **Business justification:** Cost and Total Cost of Ownership may not be enough to establish priorities and justification with the business. During the Assess process, options and guidance for creating a balanced business justification is discussed.

### Cultural Complexity

- **Change management and approval processes:** When the culture is complex, highly matrixed, or siloed the processes related to change management and approvals becomes challenging. Guidance on managing this complexity can be found in assess, migrate, and optimize processes.
- **Organizational complexity (Executive readiness):** Proper levels of executive support and leadership are critical to the success of a migration effort. If the executive team is not ready to engage, then support is unlikely to follow. This complexity is addressed during the pre-requisite and assess processes.
- **Organizational complexity (Skills readiness):** When the Cloud Adoption Team or other supporting teams are not ready to execute, it can quickly inject complexity throughout the migration effort. This challenge is addressed during each of the migration processes in a specific page on skills readiness.
- **Aligning support (Partner, service, and support options):** Within each of the the processes outlined, there are ways in which a partner, services from the cloud vendor, and/or support from the cloud vendor can aid in execution. In each of the porcesses sections a page on support alignment will discuss the options further.

### Technical Complexity

- **Existing data center constraints:** Often times companies choose to migrate to the cloud because the capacity, speed, and stability of an existing data center is no longer satisfactory. Unfortunately, those same constraints add complexity to the migration process, requiring additional planning during the assessment and migration processes.
- **Migrating at scale:** Migrations exceeding 2,000 assets are likely to run into constraints that require additional planning and a disciplined approach to execution. The Assess and Migrate processes are adjusted to account for scale complexity.
- **Multiple geographical regions:** The business operates in multiple geographic regions with disparate data sovereignty requirements. To meet those requirements, additional considerations should be factored into the pre-requisite review and distribution of assets during migration.
- **Multiple data centers:** Migration of multiple data centers adds a great deal of complexity. During Assess, Migrate, Optimization, and Manage processes, additional considerations will be discussed.
- **Governance or compliance strategy:** When governance and compliance are vital to the success of a migration, additional alignment between IT Governance teams and the Cloud Adoption team is required.
- **Technical complexity (Change management):** Extensive solution architectures, long standing technical debt, and interdependencies can create a complexity that should be addressed during assess, migrate, and optimize processes.

## Next steps

The next steps are best determined by the reader's current challenges and the process the reader is attempting to improve.

Choose one of the following processes to begin addressing complexity:

- [Assess](./assess/index.md)
- [Migrate](./migrate/index.md)
- [Optimize](./optimize-and-promote/index.md)
- [Secure and Manage](./secure-and-manage/index.md).
