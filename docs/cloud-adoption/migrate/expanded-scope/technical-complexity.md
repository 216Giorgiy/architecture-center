# Technical complexity (Change management)

- **Technical complexity (Change management):** Extensive solution architectures, long standing technical debt, and interdependencies can create a complexity that should be addressed during assess, migrate, and optimize processes.

## General scope expansion

Summarize the general approach to overcoming this challenge

## Suggested pre-requisites

What should be done prior to the migration process to reduce the impact of this complexity.

## Assess process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the assess process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Migrate process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the migrate process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Optimize and promote process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the optimize and promote process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Secure and manage process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the secure and manage process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.
