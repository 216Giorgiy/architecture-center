# Migration Backlog Review

The actionable output of the plan phase, is a migration backlog. The migration backlog influences all of the pre-requisites discussed so far. Development of the migration backlog should be completed as a first pre-requisite. This article serves as a milestone to close out pre-requisite activities.

The Cloud Strategy Team is accountable for the care and maintenance of the digital estate. However, the realization of that the resultant backlog is the responsibility of every member of the migration effort. As a final step of the pre-requisites, it is advised that the Cloud Strategy Team and Cloud Adoption Team invest time to review and understand the migration backlog. During that review, it is important that all members of both teams gain sufficient knowledge to be able to articulate the following key points within the migration backlog.

## Business outcomes and metrics

Every member of the team should have a clear understanding of the desired business outcomes. Migrations take time. It's easy for team members to become distracted by urgent but less important activities during migration. Establishing and reinforcing the desired outcomes helps the team understand the priority and relative importance of the migration, enabling better decision making over time.

Tracking migration progress is equally important to the motivation of the team and continued stakeholder support. Progress can be tracked through migration KPIs and learning metrics. However, the effort is tracked, it is important that the team is aware of these metrics, so they can evaluate performance during subsequent iterations.

## Business Priorities

At times prioritization of one workload over another may seem illogical to the Cloud Adoption Team. Understanding the business priorities that drove those decisions can go along way to maintain motivation within the Cloud Adoption Team. It also allows the Cloud Adoption Team to participate as a stronger partner in the prioritization process.

## Core Assumptions

The article on [Digital Estate Rationalization](../../../digital-estate/rationalize.md) discusses the agility and time saving impact of basic assumptions when evaluating a digital estate. To fully realize those values, it is important that the cloud adoption team understand the assumptions and the reason those assumptions were established. That knowledge will better equipt the Cloud Adoption Team to challenge those assumptions.

## Next steps

With a general understanding of the digital estate and migration backlog, the team is ready to move beyond pre-requisites and begin [assessing workloads](../assess/index.md).
