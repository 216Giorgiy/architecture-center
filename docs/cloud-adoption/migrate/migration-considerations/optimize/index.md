# Optimize migrated workloads

After a workload has been migrated to the cloud, it can be prepared for production usage. In this process, activities will ready to workload, size dependent assets, and prepare the business for the coming change.

## Objective

The objective of optimization is to prepare a migrated workload for production usage.

## Definition of Done

The optimization process is complete when a workload has been properly configured, sized, and released for production usage.

## Accountability during optimization

The cloud adoption team is accountable for the entire optimization process. However, members of the cloud strategy team, cloud operations team, and cloud governance team will also be responsible for activities within this process.

## Responsibilities during optimization

In addition to the high level accountability, there are a number of actions that an individual or group of individuals will need to be directly responsible for. The following are a few activities that will require assignments to responsible parties.

* **Business testing:** Resolve any compatibility issues that prevent the workload from being migrated to the cloud
    * It is advised that power users from within the business participate heavily in testing of the migrated workload. Depending on the degree of optimization attempted, multiple testing cycles may be required
* **Business change plan:** Development of a plan for user adoption, changes to business processes, modification to business KPIs or learning metrics as a result of the migration effort.
* **Benchmark and Optimize:** Study of the business testing and automated testing to benchmark performance. Based on usage, the cloud adoption team will refine sizing of the deployed assets to balance cost and performance.
* **Ready:** Prepare the workload and environment for the support of on-going production usage of the workload.
* **Promote:** Redirect production traffic to the migrated and optimized workload, this activity represents the completion of a release cycle.

In addition to core activities, there are a few parallel activities that will require specific assignments and execution plans.

* **Retrospective:** Every release creates an opportunity for deeper learning and adoption of a growth mindset. Upon the completion of each release cycle, it is advised that the cloud adoption team evaluate the processes used during migration to identify improvements.
* **Decomission:** Generally, cost savings can be realized from a migration, when the previous production assets are decomissioned and properly disposed of.

## Next steps

With a general understanding of the optimization process, the reader is ready begin the process by [establishing a business change plan for the candidate workload](./business-change-plan.md).
