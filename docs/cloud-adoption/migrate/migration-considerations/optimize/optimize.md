# Benchmark and Optimize Cloud Assets

Monitoring usage and spending is critically important for cloud infrastructures. Organizations pay for the resources they consume over time. When usage exceeds agreement thresholds, unexpected cost overages can quickly accumulate. Cost Management Reports monitor spending to analyze and track cloud usage, costs, and trends. Using Over Time reports, detect anomalies that differ from normal trends. Inefficiencies in cloud deployment are visible in optimization reports. Note inefficiencies in cost-analysis reports.

In the traditional on-premise models of IT, requisition of IT systems is costly and time consuming. The processes often require lengthy capital expenditure review cycles and may even require an annual planning process. As such, it is common practice buy more than is needed. It is equally common for IT administrators to then over-provision assets in preparation for for anticipated future demands.

In the cloud, the accounting and provisioning models eliminate the time delays that lead to over-buying. When an asset needs additional resources, it can simply be scaled up or out nearly instantly. This means that assets can be safely be reduced in size to minimize resources and costs consumed. During benchmarking and optimization, the cloud adoption team seeks to find the balance between performance and costs, provisioning assets to be no larger and no smaller than is necessary to meet production demands.

## Should assets be optimized during the or after migration?

This is one of the most common questions regarding optimization. When should an asset be optimized? The easy answer is both. However, that's not entirely accurate. To explain, lets start with two basic definitions:

* Resize: Often times an asset is so grossly oversized & underutilized that it can be easily resized during deployment. The ultimate test of resizing is the UAT test. When a power user performs a UAT test, does the user experience performance or functionality losses? If not, the asset has been successfully sized.
* Optimization: Optimization is a data-driven approach to resource size management. Using benchmarks of the asset and applications performance, an IT team can make educated decisions regarding the most appropriate size, services, scale, and architecture of a solution. They can then Resize and test performance theories.

During the migration, use educated guesses and experiment with sizing. However, true optimization of resources requires data based on actual performance in a cloud environment. for true optimization to occur, the IT team must first implement approaches to monitoring performance and resource utilization.

## Benchmark and Optimize with Azure Cost Management

Azure Cost Management licensed by Cloudyn, a Microsoft subsidiary, manages cloud spend with transparency and accuracy. This service monitors, benchmarks, allocates, and optimizes cloud costs.

Historical data can help manage costs by analyzing usage and costs over time to identify trends. Trends are then used to forecast future spending. Cost Management also includes useful projected cost reports. Cost allocation manages costs by analyzing costs based on tagging policies. Use cost allocation for showback/chargeback to show resource utilization and associated costs to influence consumption behaviors or charge tenant customers. Access control helps manage costs by ensuring that users and teams access only the cost management data that they need. Alerting helps manage costs through automatic notification when unusual spending or overspending occurs. Alerts can also notify other stakeholders automatically for spending anomalies and overspending risks. Various reports support alerts based on budget and cost thresholds.

## Improve efficiency

Determine optimal VM usage, identify idle VMs, or remove idle VMs and unattached disks with Cost Management. Using information in Sizing Optimization and Inefficiency reports, create a plan to down-size or remove idle VMs.

## Next steps

Once a workload has been tested and optimized, it is time to [ready the workload for promotion](./ready.md).
