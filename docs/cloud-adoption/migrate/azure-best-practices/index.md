# Azure Migration Best Practices

Included in the Azure platform are a number of tools to aid in execution of a migration effort. This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework is designed to help readers implement those tools in alignment with best practices for migration. For each of readership, each best practice is aligned to one of the processes within the CAF Migration Model pictured below.

Expand any process in the Table of Contents (TOC) to the left, to see best practices typically required during that process.
