# Executive readiness

- **Organizational complexity (Executive readiness):** Proper levels of executive support and leadership are critical to the success of a migration effort. If the executive team is not ready to engage, then support is unlikely to follow. This complexity is addressed during the pre-requisite and assess processes.

## Approach to addressing complexity

Summarize the general approach to overcoming this challenge

## Suggested pre-requisites

What should be done prior to the migration process to reduce the impact of this complexity.

## Assess process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the assess process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Migrate process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the migrate process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Optimize and promote process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the optimize and promote process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.

## Secure and manage process changes

How does the baseline solution need to change to address this complexity

### Suggested action during the secure and manage process

Actionable go-do steps... When possible outline the technical change required.
