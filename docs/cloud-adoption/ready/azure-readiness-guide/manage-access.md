# Manage access to your Azure environment with role-based access controls

Managing access to your Azure resources and subscriptions, who can access what, forms an important part of your Azure governance strategy. Role-based access control (RBAC) is the primary method of managing access in Azure.

RBAC provides fine-grained access management of resources in Azure. It helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and what scopes they can access.

When planning your access control strategy, grant users the least privilege to get their work done. The following image shows a suggested pattern for assigning RBAC.

When you plan your access and control methodology, we recommend you work with people in your organizations with the following roles: security and compliance, IT administration, and enterprise architect.
